## üîç What is this?

**IDA-RPC** is a simple Python script that integrates with any version of IDA (Pro, Freeware, Home) with Discord Rich Presence.

When you're disassembling a binary in IDA, your Discord profile will automatically show:
- That you're using IDA
- The name of the binary you're analyzing

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently Linux-only, since it uses `xdotool` to grab window titles.
